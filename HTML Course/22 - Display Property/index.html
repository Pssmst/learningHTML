        display: property specifies if/how an element is displayed

        block-level: start on a new line, take up the full width available (h1, div, p, form, header, footer)
        inline:      do not start on a new line, width is limited to what is needed (span, a, img)
    -->

    <h1>Display Property</h1>

    <h3>Block</h3>

    <p>(All the white space to the right of the div and the <mark>block</mark>-level span is allocated to those elements.)</p>
    <div id="div1">div (automatically a block)</div>
    <span id="span1">span (regular)</span>
    <span id="span2">span (block)</span>

    
    <h3>Inline</h3>

    <div id="div2">div (inline)</div>
    <span id="span3">span (inline)</span>
    Now that the two elements are <mark>inline</mark>, they are part of this paragraph.


    <h3>Inline-Block</h3>

    <div id="div3">div (inline-block)</div>
    <span id="span4">span (inline-block)</span>
    These elements are <mark>still inline</mark>, but can each be specified a width and height. When dealing with <mark>inline-block</mark>, you can set elements' visibilities to <mark>hidden</mark>, which is what I did with the div element. This hides the element, although it still is a tangible, interactible thing on the webpage.

    
    <h3>None</h3>

    <div id="div4">div (none)</div>
    <span id="span5">span (none)</span>
    The <mark>none</mark> display property literally just erases the elements from existence. There was once a div and span here.
